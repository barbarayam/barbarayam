- 👋 Hi, I’m @barbarayam
- 👀 I’m interested in everything Python; data analytics and automation!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use Git and Machine Learning using Python.
- 🔥 I first started publishing on Git since 2017 and though I have been consistently working on programming - dabbling in Python, Html, CSS, Javascript, R 
- 🔥🔥 through a variety of courses such as CS50, even tried 42, and many other courses, this time, I am determined to stay focus and make commits on a regular basis.
- 💞️ I love all things programming, and looking for like-minded individuals so that we may collaborate and grow in code together. 
- 📫 You can reach me at my email: yam.barbara@gmail.com
      & also my personal website: www.barbarayam.com
